# 问题描述

Vasiliy has an exam period which will continue for n days. He has to pass exams on m subjects. Subjects are numbered from 1 to m.

About every day we know exam for which one of m subjects can be passed on that day. Perhaps, some day you can't pass any exam. It is not allowed to pass more than one exam on any day.

On each day Vasiliy can either pass the exam of that day (it takes the whole day) or prepare all day for some exam or have a rest.

About each subject Vasiliy know a number ai — the number of days he should prepare to pass the exam number i. Vasiliy can switch subjects while preparing for exams, it is not necessary to prepare continuously during ai days for the exam number i. He can mix the order of preparation for exams in any way.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams, or determine that it is impossible. Each exam should be passed exactly one time.

**Input**

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105) — the number of days in the exam period and the number of subjects.

The second line contains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (0 ≤ di ≤ m), where di is the number of subject, the exam of which can be passed on the day number i. If di equals 0, it is not allowed to pass any exams on the day number i.

The third line contains m positive integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105), where ai is the number of days that are needed to prepare before passing the exam on the subject i.

**Output**

Print one integer — the minimum number of days in which Vasiliy can pass all exams. If it is impossible, print -1.


# 问题分析
>问题大意是 给定每天可以考试的科目d[i] 以及每门科目所需要的复习时间。要求完成所有考试科目所需要的最少天数。
>这题嘛，根据提示使用二分答案方法写的，结合贪心思想。主要思路就是**先二分天数**，然后对每一个科目都**贪心最后一天能考的天数考**，判断天数是否满足条件。二分天数时条件要注意。
